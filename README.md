### Description

A checkers board game simulation with working 2 player (2 humans) and 1 player (1 human vs PC) modes. The code is not complete but most of the functions are finished and it should be workable. It uses a minimax depth first search procedure runs (to a search depth of 5-6) to decide what move to do (AI only) the rules are adjustable but some are not yet completely implemented. Expect updates quite regularly - if you can make any changes please email them to me.
