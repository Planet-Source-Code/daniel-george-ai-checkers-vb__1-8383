This is the beginnings of a checkers program.

It is now where near completion but it should work at the momment.
The code is not complete and the interface is not either. If you do any work on it please email
a copy of the modified code to 'heed435@yahoo.com' with a readme file detailing any changes.

I will continually repost updated code over the next few months.

The checkers graphics are by Mark (he also has code at www.planet-source-code) i hope he doesn't mind me using his but mine look stupid (square blocks!).

if he is reading this thank you for the graphics.

if you do not have 128MB RAM i suggest you turn down the size of the states array. This is in the AI module- it says 'dim States(500000)' change it to about 'dim States(100000)'. You also have to change the number in the newstate function to the same number to stop overflows.
